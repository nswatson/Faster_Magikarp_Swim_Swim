CSCI-E3: Intro to Web Programming with JavaScript

Final Project

Author: Nicole Watson

I created a Flappy Bird-based game called "Faster, Magikarp! Swim! Swim!" It has some of the functionality 
as the original Flappy Bird but with a few differences. I created this with vanilla JavaScript,
no libraries. All sprites, sound effects, and background images are from online public databases,
and they're royalty-free and do not require credit.
